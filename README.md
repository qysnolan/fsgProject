Explaination
-----
<p>This is the demo of the idea to show the data. Due to the short time, some of the work just partial finished. However, it shows the idea here.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    The back end should be divided by several application to execute different functions. Because database has already been done, it has only one application.
  </li>
  <li>
    This web application doesn't do anything about authentication. It just shows the "entrance" to user.
  </li>
  <li>
    D3 graphs on homepage show how does the D3 work, but the "link" in those graphs just redirect to some random pages that I chose.
  </li>
  <li>
    All of the "Add..." buttons just redirect to homepage. So do the "Return" and "Rent".
  </li>
  <li>
    All of the "detail" pages just contain basic infomation, but in future more infomation can be added.
  </li>
  <li>
    All of the "list" pages just do searching and sorting of the data on that page except that "Movie" can be searched in all dataset on the top bar. However all of them can search and sort in all dataset.
  </li>
</ul>
